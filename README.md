# HARP-150-Game-Assignment
Me and my partner Kelly Lin created a Space themed game inspired by Oregon Trail.

Space Odyssey: The player takes the role of a survivor launched into space after a calamity wiped out Earth. They are tasked with finding a hospitable planet for the rest of humanity. We named it 'Space Odyssey' because more than anything, this game represents a journey akin to the one that Odysseus himself took- all in the name of getting 'home' (wherever that may be).

Both of us contributed equally to the code. Kelly planned out all the text so that the player would understand each action they make and to have a cool story along with a functional game. Nate wrote the code for the Player and Enemy_Ship classes, fight_sequence, and most of the main function. Kelly wrote the code for the shop and asteroid_event. Together, we both debugged the code and helped each other find ways to make our code more streamlined. Overall, we both contributed the same amount of work towards our game project and collaboratively coded to make the best game we could!
